<br/>

A powerful bookmark manager for the fish shell with sophisticated fuzzy matching. Easily save, organize, and navigate to your most frequently used directories.

## Features

- üìÇ Save and manage directory bookmarks
- üîç Advanced fuzzy matching for quick navigation
- üè† Smart handling of $HOME paths for portability
- üéØ Sophisticated scoring system for finding the best match
- üöÄ Fast and dependency-free implementation

## Install

```fish
$ omf install m
```

## Usage

```fish
# Show help information
$ m -h

# Save current directory as a bookmark
$ m -s project_name

# Jump to a saved bookmark
$ m project_name

# Jump with fuzzy matching (e.g., 'proj' will match 'project_name')
$ m proj

# List all bookmarks
$ m -l

# Search for bookmarks matching a pattern
$ m -f pattern

# Delete a bookmark
$ m -d bookmark_name

# Print the path of a bookmark
$ m -p bookmark_name

# Edit bookmarks file directly
$ m -e
```

## Fuzzy Matching

The fuzzy matching system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm:

- Prefix matches are prioritized (e.g., "doc" matches "documents")
- Substring matches are scored next (e.g., "ument" matches "documents")
- Path matches are considered (matching text in the bookmark path)
- Character-by-character partial matches as a fallback

This allows you to quickly navigate to your bookmarks even if you can't remember the exact name.
